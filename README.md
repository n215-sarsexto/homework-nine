Following the trend of dynamic content, this introduces the concept of "MVC" or Model-View-Controller. Using MVC, it allows for a separation of data, and its manipulation. While not a lot of data is used in this project, it's a good insight into how it works for future projects. In this case, the "model" is the page content, which usually would be data stored and retrieved from/on a server. This was a rather easy project for me to execute, as I had a great base to work off of from class. It also was rather fun for me to come up with the content, as Echeverian plants are a favorite of mine. Huge shoutout to Mountain Crest Gardens (https://mountaincrestgardens.com/) for being a content reference!
