      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        Echeveria (ek-uh-VAIR-ee-uh) are popular rose-shaped soft
        succulents with a remarkable pastel color palette. Some
        varieties can grow to the size of a dinner plate and their
        pearlescent tones make them stunning focal points for potted
        arrangements, rock gardens, favors, d√©cor, and much more. The
        rich diversity of colors, shapes, and sizes of Echeveria make
        them great additions to any project or event.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="appearance">
      <h2>Appearance</h2>
      <p>
        Colors: Echeveria show a wide variety of pastel pinks, purples,
        blues, and greens and can be two-toned or have contrasting leaf
        tips. The color of a single plant is variable, with more vibrant
        colors appearing when the plant receives more light.
      </p>
      <p>
        Form: These rosette-shaped plants send out new offsets on
        stolons (horizontal stems), and if given space, the colony will
        spread outward from the mother plant.
      </p>
      <p>
        Foliage: Leaves can be velvety, fuzzy, smooth, or crinkly and
        are often coated with a powdery layer of natural wax that gives
        them a soft, glaucous look. Their thick, fleshy leaves store
        water and sustain the plant through periods of drought.
      </p>
      <p>
        Flowers: Each summer a rosette can send up a tall bloom stalk,
        from which dangle attractive, bell-shaped flowers of yellow,
        orange, or pink. The full bloom cycle can last for several weeks
        and attract migrating butterflies.

    <h2>Care</h2>
    <p>
      Light: Echeveria need a lot of light to thrive and show their best
      colors, so indoor plants need to be kept near a sunny window or
      under grow lights. Outdoor plantings can take full to partial sun;
      extra shade will protect them from sun burn on hot afternoons in
      summer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soil: Rapidly-draining, gritty soil is important for Echeveria, as
      they are accustomed to growing in small crevices in rocky
      outcroppings. They will not tolerate standing water, so choose a
      sandy soil like cactus/succulent potting mix. Soil amendments are
      not necessary, but gardeners can encourage faster growth by
      applying slow-release, low-Nitrogen fertilizer in spring.
    </p>
    <p>
      Water: Echeveria thrive on deep, infrequent watering with enough
      time between for the soil to fully dry. Water the soil directly
      (not the leaves) and be sure to use containers with drainage
      holes. Watering frequency can vary greatly, so look to the plant
      and soil for signs of needing more or less frequent water.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hardiness: Echeveria are cold hardy down to 20F-30F (zone 9-10).
      They can tolerate light frost, but should not be kept at
      consistently below-freezing temperatures. Gardeners in all
      regions, however, can enjoy Echeveria year-round as indoor plants
      - just be sure they're given plenty of direct light.
    </p>
    <p>
      Propagation: These tenacious plants can often regrow from cuttings
      of offsets, leaves, and stems. For mature, overgrown plants, you
      can use a clean, sharp knife to cut off the tighter rosette at the
      top. Let all cuttings dry in a shady spot for several days and
      replant in moist, well-draining soil. Full Guide to Succulent
